== README
Get Your Did is a rough prototype of an app which is like Open Table
for salon and beauty services.

Finding a stylist is hard, and no one has time anymore to research on Yelp
then call around to find a stylist's availability.  Get Your Did provides a service
to salons to list their available appointments, services offered and allow users to
book available appointments without having to call around.
